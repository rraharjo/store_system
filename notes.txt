compiling
general:
-I -> this flag means all the folders that has the header files
all source code (.cpp) file has to be included when compiling

with postgres, include this line:
-I "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/include" "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/lib/libpq.lib"
"C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/lib/libpq.lib" is the source file

compile inventory_test:
g++ ./src/inventory_test.cpp -I ./src/header_files ./src/source_files/inventory/*.cpp ./src/source_files/inventory/assets/*.cpp ./src/source_files/inventory/transaction/*.cpp ./src/source_files/util/database/*.cpp ./src/source_files/util/enums/date/*.cpp ./src/source_files/util/*.cpp ./src/source_files/util/enums/database/*.cpp -I "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/include" "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/16/lib/libpq.lib"
database reset:
delete * from purchase_entry ; delete * from sellable ;
